This website has gone through alot and I don't regret a single thing about it, I feel this website looks well, functions well and is almost complete. Couple more things I need to do are:

- Responsive Images, (SRCSET)
  5
- Add Contact section
  6
  if these are added but I didn't update the readme, well, that's on me.
