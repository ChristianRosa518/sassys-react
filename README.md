This was a website built for my mother's sandwich shop "Sassy's Specialty Sandwiches". It was my first project where I designed and developed a fullstack application, it was developed for people to buy sandwiches but it was unfortunately used mainly as a menu. The store is now shutdown so i've disabled some of the website's functionality. but feel free to browse around and take a look at our past :)
